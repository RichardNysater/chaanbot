# chaanbot

A python 3 [matrix](https://matrix.org) bot using [matrix-python-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk).
The bot is extensible and currently provides:
* Highlight module allows users to easily notify groups of users.
E.g. "!hl javadevs spring-boot vs micronaut?" would highlight/notify any user in the javadevs group.
* Weather module allows users to broadcast weather reports.
* More to come!

Bot is under active development and severe breaking changes should be expected until a stable release is created.

# Install instructions
Chaanbot requires Python 3.

Add user for bot. Not required but recommended:
```
sudo adduser --disabled-password chaanbot
sudo su chaanbot
```

Create virtual environment and install bot and its dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv chaanbot
source chaanbot/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install chaanbot
```

Start bot to initialize config file creation, then edit the config file to your liking.
Config file location is the user's config directory as determined by appdirs, typical locations are:

        Mac OS X:  ~/Library/Application Support/chaanbot/chaanbot.cfg
        Unix:      ~/.config/chaanbot/chaanbot.cfg or in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, if defined
        Win *:     C:\Users\<username>\AppData\[local or roaming]\chaanbot\chaanbot\chaanbot.cfg

Output of running the bot will also show where the config file is located:
```
chaanbot
nano .config/chaanbot/chaanbot.cfg
```

Bot should now be runnable as chaanbot user:
```
chaanbot
```

For convenience bot can be added as service.
With sudo access, copy chaanbot.service file to /etc/systemd/system/chaanbot.service:
```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/chaanbot.service
```
Bot is now startable from systemctl:

```
sudo service chaanbot start
```

And can be set to run on boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable chaanbot
```

# Upgrading version
```
sudo su chaanbot
source /home/chaanbot/chaanbot/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -U chaanbot
```

# TODO
* Port over to matrix-nio instead of matrix-client
* Improve error handling
* Integration tests and better test coverage
* More modules
* Improve installation documentation for non-Ubuntu 18.04 installations :-)
* Use Poetry for dependency management?
